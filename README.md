## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

As this was my second challenge, I was able to figure out how to build the elements faster.

### Continued development

I couldn't create the cards the same way the example showed, since I didn't figure out a way to erase the card group border.

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/left-align-and-right-align-text-on-the-same-line/) - This helped me to align the second card text separately.
